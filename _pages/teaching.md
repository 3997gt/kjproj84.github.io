   * I worked for the same project called ["Understanding Heap-Spraying Attacks"](http://courses.cs.vt.edu/cs2506/Spring2018/C/HS/handout.pdf). (I studied this work with about 540 VT undergrad students).
   * I also had two Info sessions. See [my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nx5RuC0M54S65wXEbromVo19iX3_wWTvXKEY5DarlOc/edit?usp=sharing).
