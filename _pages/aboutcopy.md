I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I am a member of the Software Innovation Lab, advised by [Prof. Eli Tilevich](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/). My Research Topics are Software Engineering and Distributed Systems. Previously, I worked in Robotics Research at KIST as a research engineer and I completed my master degree at POSTECH, studied for multimedia networking.
