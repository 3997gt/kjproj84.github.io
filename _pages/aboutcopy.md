I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). I am a member of the Software Innovation Lab, advised by [Prof. Eli Tilevich](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/). My research topics are Software Engineering and Distributed Systems. Previously, I worked in Robotics Research at KIST and in access R&D team at SK telesys. And I hold my masters degree from [POSTECH](http://postech.ac.kr/eng/), studied for multimedia networking.
